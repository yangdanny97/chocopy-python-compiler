/**
 * Runtime support for running WASM compiled from Chocopy
 * 
 * This is a very minimal runtime since the goal was to implement as much as 
 * possible directly in WASM. 
 * 
 * The only imports from JS to WASM are for `console.log` and `console.assert`,
 * and the latter isn't even strictly necessary.
 * 
 * The memory buffer is instantiated by JS, but after that it's never written 
 * to and only used to print strings.
