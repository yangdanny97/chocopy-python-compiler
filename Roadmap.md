This document is a rough outline of what needs to be implemented for the LLVM phase of the Chocopy compiler.
Each item is designed to be built on top of the previous item, and represents a milestone where additional test programs can be compiled.

1. add standard library `print` for int and bool, finish basic language features supporting int and bool
2. lists, indexing, iteration, add standard library `len`
3. strings
4. classes, attributes, methods
